# Chekilytics

A personal project for visualizing my personal collection of idol cheki pictures.

The current work has been on the visualization of various metrics relating to the provenance of each cheki. 

# startup

Use poetry to generate the virtual environment.

```bash
poetry install && poetry shell
```

Then begin the streamlit application.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Future roadmap

* Migrate out of google sheets, or improve the ETL processes.
* Add integration with actual pictures of the cheki in cloud storage.
* Better maintenance of metadata
* 日本語
* data input through interface
